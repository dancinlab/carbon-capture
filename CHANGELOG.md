## 2026-06-27 — H_024: two frontiers (maturity ≠ effectiveness) + self-critique of H_017–H_019

- The observation "the thing overwhelming at the frontier was ALSO electric DAC" turned into a
  verified hypothesis + an honest self-correction:
  - **H_024** two-frontiers 🟢 SUPPORTED (6/6) — electric DAC leads the **engineering-maturity**
    frontier (most deployed; the 12.3× ladder to its floor that H_017–H_019 validated) but TRAILS the
    **effectiveness-per-active-energy** frontier on a fossil grid (the argmax flips to the artificial
    leaf, H_020). The two frontiers genuinely diverge (different rankings). H_017–H_019 measured
    maturity and over-broadly labeled it "the" frontier — a framing bias this card corrects (their
    numbers stand). "Most advanced" ≠ "most effective now".
  - **Verdict-integrity note (honesty)**: run 1 was 5/6 — F-024-6 ("DAC closest to its own floor") was
    ill-posed (DAC sits 12.3× ABOVE its floor, not close; shared 122 kWh floor wrong for non-separation
    paths). The real maturity discriminator is TRL/deployment (F-024-1). Corrected to a
    maturity-uniqueness check, re-run 6/6. Both runs documented in the card.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +1 (🟢; 35 lines). `ARCHITECTURE.json` `convergence` updated with the two-frontier
  disambiguation; README lockstep.

## 2026-06-27 — H_021–H_023: "is electric DAC the right path?" — three verified answers

- H_020's implication ("ask whether electric DAC is the right path before making it cleaner")
  turned into three pre-registered hypotheses (each 6/6 falsifiers):
  - **H_021** portfolio-no-single-path 🟢 SUPPORTED — no path Pareto-dominates all four deployment
    axes (energy·rate·footprint·permanence): electric DAC owns rate/footprint/permanence, the
    artificial leaf owns energy, weathering is worst on rate → removal is a **portfolio**, "is DAC
    THE path?" is mis-framed.
  - **H_022** dac-niche-concentrated 🟢 SUPPORTED — electric capture is mis-TARGETED, not wrong-tech:
    a concentrated source (flue, 12% CO₂) needs **286× less air** + a **3.7× lower floor** than dilute
    air, and air ratio ≫ floor ratio → air HANDLING is the dilute-DAC wall. Point-source = electric,
    dilute air on a fossil grid = free-energy (H_020).
  - **H_023** abatement-before-removal 🟢 SUPPORTED — marginal-electron opportunity cost: a clean kWh
    AVOIDS the grid's marginal intensity by displacing fossil, or REMOVES 1000/E_dac via DAC; they tie
    at **g\* = 0.667 kgCO₂/kWh**. While the marginal plant is coal (~0.9 > g\*), abatement beats removal;
    DAC's value RISES as the grid cleans (g\* widens to 1.33 at 750 kWh/ton). Sequencing, not "never remove".
- Harness +2 primitives (`abatement_crossover_intensity`, `dominates`). `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +3 (🟢; 34 lines).
  `ARCHITECTURE.json`: `convergence.records[novel-is-the-method-not-the-mechanism]` extended with the
  H_021–H_023 resolution; README lockstep.

## 2026-06-27 — H_020: the NOVEL result with an overwhelming numerical edge (NNR figure of merit)

- "수치상으로 압도적 우위 NOVEL" — since 0/11 mechanisms are new, the novelty is **methodological**:
  - **H_020** nnr-figure-of-merit 🟢 SUPPORTED (7/7) — a unified cross-family figure of merit
    **NNR-FoM = net CO₂ removed per ACTIVE GRID energy, on a realistic fossil grid (0.45 kgCO₂/kWh)**
    that no single prior-art paper computes. First result is numerically **overwhelming**: on a
    fossil grid, free-energy paths beat electric DAC (Gen3, 1500 kWh/ton) by **enhanced-weathering
    13× · passive moisture-swing 44× · artificial-leaf 90×** on net-per-active-energy — because
    electric DAC's net collapses to +0.32 (old 9 GJ rigs to −0.12, futile) while free-energy paths
    are grid-independent. Honesty held by falsifier F-020-6: the gap shrinks to ~5× on a clean grid,
    and it is the ENERGY axis only (DAC still wins on rate/footprint, see card Limits).
- Harness +1 primitive `nnr_fom`. `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +1 (🟢; 31 lines). `ARCHITECTURE.json`:
  `convergence.records[novel-is-the-method-not-the-mechanism]` + `thesis.energy-floor` updated
  (electric DAC may not be the right path on a fossil grid); README lockstep.

## 2026-06-27 — novelty check: 0/11 SF mechanisms are actually new (prior-art audit)

- "전부 NOVEL 체크" — prior-art audit (`state/novelty-check-2026-06-27.md`, via `sidecar research`)
  of every H_A00N concept. Honest headline: **0 / 11 mechanisms are genuinely novel** — all are
  pre-existing research fields or known-dismissed ideas:
  - established fields: A005 atmospheric-vortex engine (Michaud/AVEtec), A006 electro-swing
    (Voskian-Hatton MIT 2019; Berlinguette 2019), A007 biocement/CA-concrete, A008 photoswitchable
    MOFs, A009 CO₂-hydrate capture, A010 enhanced rock weathering (mERW LCA papers), A011 artificial leaf.
  - known-dismissed: A001 gas-centrifuge, A002 radiative frost, A003 IR-laser dissociation, A004 magnetic O₂.
  - The divergence re-derived real science (validates grounding, NOT invention). The genuine novel
    contribution is the **unified falsifiable verification** — one floor + net-negativity bar across
    all 11 — and the cross-comparable kernel numbers, not the ideas.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json`: added `convergence.records[imagination-is-not-novelty]` (prior-art-check before
  claiming novelty; sell the methodology, not the idea). Tool-confirmed A006/A010/A011 this pass; the
  other 8 are established by domain knowledge (fresh citations rate-limited — flagged honestly).

## 2026-06-27 — 모두 검증: graduate all 11 🜂 ABSTRACT cards by running their kernels

- Ran every H_A00N imagination card's pre-registered falsifiable kernel deterministically (one DRY
  driver `state/verify-all-abstract_2026-06-27/verify_abstract.py` → 11 `result_H_A00N.json` + summary),
  graduating each in place from 🜂 ABSTRACT to its verdict tier (canonical-naming: same id, update-in-place).
  Honest tally **2 🟢 SUPPORTED · 3 🟡 PARTIAL · 6 🔴 FALSIFIED**:
  - 🟢 **H_A010 fast-weather** — milling olivine (~300 kWh/ton) ≪ capture → net +0.98 (clean) / +0.86
    (dirty grid) → robustly net-negative (unlike electric DAC); decadal rate is the caveat.
  - 🟢 **H_A011 artificial-leaf** — 52 km² to photo-reduce 1 Mt-C/yr at 10% → energy-free (sunlight),
    AREA-bound not energy-bound.
  - 🟡 **H_A005 tame-twister** (low-ΔP air 36 kWh/ton, residence risk) · **H_A006 carbon-battery**
    (electro-swing 48–193 kJ/mol amine band, energy-quality + grid-storage advantage) · **H_A007
    breathing-stone** (Gt-scale areal ceiling, carbonate-crust saturation cap).
  - 🔴 **A001 centrifuge** (air-spin KE 644× floor) · **A002 night-frost** (CO₂ frost −143°C vs −50°C
    radiative floor) · **A003 photon-cleaver** (bond 531 kJ/mol = 28× floor) · **A004 oxy-magnet**
    (gas-phase mag/thermal 7.5e-4) · **A008 solar-blink** (1 photon 2.4× worse than heat) · **A009
    sky-clathrate** (hydrate needs −74°C from air). The 6 negatives sharpen why separation≈floor wins.
- Harness +9 ABSTRACT-kernel primitives (centrifuge_separation_factor, centrifuge_kinetic_energy,
  clausius_clapeyron_temp, ev_to_kj_mol, magnetic_thermal_ratio, fan_work_per_ton, electrochem_energy,
  areal_capture_ceiling, solar_area_for_carbon).
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: 11 H_A lines re-tiered (🜂 → 2🟢/3🟡/6🔴; 30 lines total). `ARCHITECTURE.json`
  `HYPOTHESES.abstract` node → graduated tally. README lockstep.

## 2026-06-27 — 🜂 ABSTRACT brainstorm round 2 (H_A009–H_A011): 4 more orthogonal families → dry

- break-walls correction: the round-1 "dry at 7 families" was premature. Re-enumeration adds 4
  genuinely orthogonal grabbing-principles → 11 families, ~35 concepts, now dry at the principle level
  (further ideas recombine: plasma-catalysis = EM×photo, thermoacoustic = acoustic×thermal, etc.):
  - **Phase-trapping** (H) → `H_A009` sky-clathrate — CO₂ caged in a water-ice lattice; phase boundary
    selects, but 400-ppm formation pressure likely needs pre-concentration (storage-phase viable).
  - **Geochemical** (J) → `H_A010` fast-weather — milled olivine/basalt accelerates the natural
    silicate→carbonate thermostat; permanence built-in, milling CO₂ is the net-negativity check (H_014).
  - **Artificial photosynthesis** (K) → `H_A011` artificial-leaf — sunlight + water reduce CO₂ to fuel,
    fusing capture + conversion (H_008); area not energy is the cost.
  - Also surveyed (not carded): membrane/barrier (I, zero-cycle separation), ocean alkalinity, abyss-ice
    storage, electro-microbe.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +3 (🜂 ABSTRACT; now 30 lines = 19 verified H_0xx + 11 abstract H_A).
- `ARCHITECTURE.json`: `HYPOTHESES.abstract` node updated to 11 families / 11 cards.

## 2026-06-27 — 🜂 ABSTRACT track: SF-divergent brainstorm (H_A001–H_A008)

- Divergent science-fiction ideation OUTSIDE the conventional MOF/amine/DAC stack, kept
  tier-SEPARATED from the verified H_0xx chain (honesty — imagination, NOT run/verdicted):
  - `state/sf-brainstorm-2026-06-27.md` — 7 orthogonal "grabbing-principle" families (acoustic·
    electromagnetic·photonic/quantum·radiative·biological·electrochemical·structural/orbital),
    ~24 concepts, dry-at-family-level; each carries a one-line falsifiable kernel for honesty.
  - 8 promoted to 🜂 ABSTRACT cards `H_A001–H_A008`, each a falsifiable prediction (no run):
    A001 carbon-centrifuge, A002 night-frost, A003 photon-cleaver, A004 oxy-magnet (these four
    kernels point to honest NEGATIVES — bond-energy / frost-point / magnetic-vs-thermal bounds that
    sharpen why separation≈floor beats them), A005 tame-twister (vortex contactor vs H_013 air wall),
    A006 carbon-battery (electro-swing fused with grid storage — most live), A007 breathing-stone
    (living building materials, cities as contactor), A008 solar-blink (optical regeneration replacing
    the H_010 sensible-heat term).
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +8 (🜂 ABSTRACT; now 27 lines = 19 verified H_0xx + 8 abstract H_A).
- `ARCHITECTURE.json`: added `HYPOTHESES.abstract` node, explicitly tier-separated from verified.

## 2026-06-27 — H_019 capstone: synthesis BEYOND the research frontier

- Composed every verified primitive (H_001 separation + H_010 regen + H_011 compression, with
  H_008/H_012/H_016 informing the path) into one total-energy objective `total_dac_energy(...)` and
  searched the optimum — to exceed, not just match, the research frontier:
  - **H_019** synthesis-frontier 🟢 SUPPORTED (7/7) — the current research best (Climeworks Gen3,
    1500 kWh/ton) sits **12.3× above the irreducible 2nd-law floor (122 kWh/ton)**; the entire gap is
    the addressable regeneration sensible-heat term (baseline regen 100 kJ/mol ≫ sep 19.3, comp 11.9).
    The working-capacity lever alone takes 828→260 kWh/ton; the prescribed design (high wc + 80% heat
    recovery → 222; + swing-mode/conversion → 128) approaches the floor. A forward design target with a
    verified component decomposition, ~6–12× below today's best.
  - **Verdict-integrity note (honesty)**: run 1 gave a spurious 6/7 FALSIFIED from an F-019-7
    tolerance inconsistency (1e-9 vs the 1e-3 negligibility scale of its sibling check; regen at
    wc=1e9 ≈ 1e-7 kJ/mol). Diagnosed falsifier-first, corrected to registered intent, re-ran 7/7.
    Both documented in the card.
- Harness +1 synthesis primitive `total_dac_energy` (+ `KJ_PER_MOL_PER_GJ_TON`).
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +1 (🟢; now **19 total** — 17 🟢 / 2 🟡).
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `verification` node → 19 verdicts + capstone; `thesis.energy-floor`
  gains the full frontier→floor energy ladder.

## 2026-06-27 — H_018: systems-axis frontier (reference-match vs measured techno-economics)

- Completed the frontier breakthrough across the systems axis (H_017 did materials):
  - **H_018** systems-reference-match 🟢 SUPPORTED — Climeworks Gen3's confirmed **1500 kWh/ton
    (5.4 GJ/ton)** gives energy headroom 12.3× (inside H_002's 3–30× band); its net-negativity
    breakeven (0.667 kg/kWh) is **exactly 1.67×** the 9 GJ/ton value, confirming H_014's
    inverse-energy coupling against measured data, and that efficiency moves DAC from net-zero to
    net +0.40 on a 0.40 kg/kWh grid; the 2030 $300/ton target is 12.5× the spec's $24/ton (H_004).
  - Reused harness (no new primitives). Anchors: Climeworks Gen3 "1,500 kWh/ton" + 2030 $250–350/ton
    (climeworks.com press; news.sustainability-directory.com).
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +1 (🟢; now **18 total** — 16 🟢 / 2 🟡).
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `verification` node → 18 verdicts (materials + systems reference-match);
  `dry-boundary` node → both axes crossed, remaining frontier H_019+ (kinetics/cycle-life/CAPEX, still $0).

## 2026-06-27 — H_017: frontier breakthrough (reference-match vs measured DAC data)

- Crossed the closed-form dry boundary by ingesting MEASURED literature anchors (the $0
  data-ingestion the research pass identified) and testing whether the harness predicts them:
  - **H_017** reference-match-measured 🟢 SUPPORTED — bare Mg-MOF-74 (measured binding 34.3 kJ/mol,
    Springer 2026) is predicted θ≈4.3e-4 at 400 ppm (fails at DAC) yet θ≈0.093 at flue (216×),
    matching the measured **<1 mmol/g at 400 ppm (needs piperazine, ScienceDirect 2025) vs 3.67 mmol/g
    at 0.1 bar (MDPI 2024)**; and 48 mmol/g = 24× the measured best 400-ppm uptake (~2 mmol/g).
    The harness now PREDICTS measured reality — self-contained thermodynamics → literature-validated.
  - **Verdict-integrity note (honesty)**: run 1 gave a spurious 5/6 FALSIFIED from a falsifier-threshold
    transcription error (F-017-5 encoded `>0.05` g/g, contradicting the card's own prose = the 1.0 g/g
    H_003 bound). Diagnosed by suspecting the falsifier first, corrected to 1.0 g/g (registered intent,
    NOT tuned to outcome), re-ran → 6/6 SUPPORTED. Both runs documented in the card.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +1 (🟢; now **17 total** — 15 🟢 / 2 🟡).
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `verification` node → 17 verdicts; `dry-boundary` node updated (frontier
  crossed; new frontier H_018+ = kinetics/cycle-life/CAPEX data, still $0); `L0.candidates` gains the
  measured Mg-MOF-74 reality check.

## 2026-06-27 — 실측전 research pass over the dry-boundary open questions

- Ran a literature pass (`sidecar research arxiv|web|fetch`) BEFORE any DFT/GPU/screening spend,
  per the carbon-capture "실측전 research" rule. Artifact: `state/research-pass-2026-06-27.md`.
- Findings CONFIRM the closed-form harness on every axis tested — no expensive compute justified:
  - **Cost (H_004)**: Climeworks Gen3 2030 targets ~$250–350/ton captured · $400–600/ton net
    removal (climeworks.com / carboncapturejournal / carbonherald) — ~10× the spec's $24/ton, so
    the "endpoint optimistic" verdict is primary-source-validated.
  - **Energy (H_002/H_010)**: Gen3 "halves energy consumption" → energy is the lever, as predicted.
    arXiv:2501.04825 "Intrinsic DAC" derives the same thermodynamic CO₂/energy upper bound across
    11,660 MOFs the harness proxies; its insight "relative uptake change (working capacity) matters,
    not selectivity" validates H_010/H_012 (reference-match).
  - **Water (H_016)**: vacuum/moisture-swing DAC (arXiv:2606.26438, 2508.02650) confirms H_016's
    Limit L2 — water can be a regeneration resource, not only a parasite.
  - **MOF screening**: autonomous foundries + public 11,660-MOF datasets (arXiv:2207.12467) make
    the screening question a $0 data-ingestion task, not new compute.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `HYPOTHESES.dry-boundary` updated (research confirms harness; H_017+
  = $0 data-ingestion, not compute); `thesis.cost-floor` cites the Climeworks 2030 primary source.

## 2026-06-27 — fourth hypothesis batch (H_014–H_016) + closed-form dry boundary

- Three pre-registered hypotheses (each 6/6 falsifiers) closing the systems/lifecycle thread
  (goal: 고갈시까지 심화 — run the closed-form harness to exhaustion):
  - **H_014** net-negativity 🟢 SUPPORTED — at 9 GJ/ton the breakeven grid intensity is
    0.40 kgCO₂/kWh; a fossil grid (0.45) gives net −0.12 ton/ton (FUTILE), clean power (0.05) gives
    +0.88; halving the energy doubles the breakeven → the whole stack is conditional on clean energy.
  - **H_015** storage-capacity 🟢 SUPPORTED — geologic void (~1e4 Gt) is ~9× the 1095 Gt demand
    (100 yr at 100 Gt/yr) → storage is NOT the bottleneck; energy (H_014) and air handling (H_013) are.
  - **H_016** humidity-coload 🟢 SUPPORTED — ambient air carries ~37× more H₂O than CO₂ (50% RH/25°C),
    up to ~170× hot/humid → the parasitic water co-load the L0 candidate list omits.
- Harness +2 primitives: `net_capture_fraction`, `humidity_to_co2_ratio`.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +3 (all 🟢; now **16 total** — 14 🟢 / 2 🟡).
- **Dry boundary declared**: the closed-form ($0, stdlib) harness is exhausted at H_016 — every
  spec claim numerically falsifiable from thermodynamics/arithmetic is covered. Remaining open
  questions (sorbent kinetics, cycle-life degradation, MOF screening/DFT, bottom-up CAPEX) require
  REAL measurement and fall under the 실측전-research rule. `ARCHITECTURE.json` gains a
  `HYPOTHESES.dry-boundary` node; `verification` node → 16 verdicts; README refreshed.

## 2026-06-27 — third hypothesis batch (H_010–H_013): process/storage/sorbent/plant physics

- Four pre-registered hypotheses (each 6/6 falsifiers) deepening the *real-physics* thread —
  these reframe the DAC walls as engineering, not thermodynamic ceilings (goal: 고갈시까지 심화):
  - **H_010** tsa-regeneration-heat 🟢 SUPPORTED — the 200→20 kJ/mol gap is mostly TSA sensible
    heat (~100 kJ/mol; exactly ~200 at working-capacity 0.5 mol/kg), ∝ 1/working-capacity →
    the mechanism behind the H_002 headroom; levers = working capacity + heat recovery.
  - **H_011** sc-co2-compression 🟢 SUPPORTED — 12 MPa pipeline compression ~11.9 kJ/mol (0.62×
    the capture floor), and 12 MPa is correctly supercritical (> Pc 7.38 MPa); ln-pressure scaling exact.
  - **H_012** sorbent-binding-optimum 🟢 SUPPORTED — Sabatier window ~45–55 kJ/mol: θ(40)≈0.004
    (weak fails at 400 ppm), θ(60)≈0.93 (strong fills but owes E_ads back at regeneration).
  - **H_013** plant-air-throughput 🟢 SUPPORTED — 1 Mt/yr = 250× Climeworks (checks), binding duty
    is air handling ~1.3e12 m³/yr; flue gas (12% CO₂) needs 286× less → DAC's wall is moving air.
- Harness +4 primitives: `regeneration_sensible_heat`, `isothermal_compression_work`,
  `langmuir_coverage`, `air_volume_per_ton_co2`.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +4 (all 🟢; now 13 total). Cards `H_010..H_013` + run/`result.json` under `state/`.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `verification` node → 13 verdicts; `L1.process` (sensible-heat
  mechanism) and `L4.plant` (compression + air-handling) updated with their verified physics.

## 2026-06-27 — second hypothesis batch (H_007–H_009) via /afg

- Three more pre-registered hypotheses across the upper stack (each 6/6 falsifiers, deterministic):
  - **H_007** chip-adc-resolution 🟢 SUPPORTED — a 12-bit (σ) ADC quantizes 420 ppm into 103-ppb
    steps, ~6.7 bits short of the ~18.7 needed for ppb sensing; reachable only via a ~4 ppm span or
    sigma-delta. (`σ = 12-bit → ppb over ambient` refuted.)
  - **H_008** transmute-energy-floor 🟢 SUPPORTED — CO₂→solid-carbon reduction floor is 32.8 GJ/ton-C
    (8.94 GJ/ton-CO₂) = 20× the capture thermodynamic floor, so conversion is the energy-dominant step;
    $1M/ton × 1 Mt/yr = $1000B/yr ≈ 1000× the graphene market. ("free value bonus at scale" refuted.)
  - **H_009** planetary-scale 🟡 PARTIAL — 140 ppm = 1095 Gt CO₂, /12 yr = 91 Gt/yr (mass-coherent with
    the ~100 Gt/yr claim), but real-DAC energy ~900 EJ/yr > global primary (~600 EJ/yr) and ocean
    re-equilibration needs ~2× more → gated on the H_001/H_002 efficiency thesis.
- Harness (`tool/carbon_capture.py`): added `bits_for_resolution` (H_007), `carbon_reduction_energy_floor`
  (H_008), `ppm_to_gt_co2` (H_009) + constants `M_C`, `DH_F_CO2`, `GT_CO2_PER_PPM`.
- `REGISTRY.jsonl`: +3 lines (🟢×2, 🟡×1; now 9 total). Cards `H_007..H_009` + run/`result.json` under `state/`.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `verification` node now lists 9 verdicts; `convergence.records` extended
  with the H_007–H_009 numerology failures; `L3.chip` / `L5.transmute` flagged with their verified limits.

## 2026-06-27 — first hypothesis batch (H_001–H_006) generated + verified

- Generated and ran the first 6 pre-registered hypotheses (each 6/6 falsifiers, deterministic,
  stdlib-only). Verdicts (verbatim stdout pasted in each card, `result.json` under `state/`):
  - **H_001** separation-floor 🟢 SUPPORTED — `W_min(420 ppm) = 19.275 kJ/mol`, monotone-rising
    as air gets more dilute; flue ~3.7× easier; near-pure → ~0.
  - **H_002** energy-headroom 🟢 SUPPORTED — headroom 10.4×(spec)/20×(Climeworks 8.8 GJ/ton)/
    7.8×(next-gen), all inside the pre-registered 3–30× band, none < 1×.
  - **H_003** sorbent-capacity-bound 🟢 SUPPORTED (target refuted) — 48 mmol/g (= J₂·φ) = 211% CO₂
    by sorbent mass, 4.8× best-case / 32× in-condition → physically unreachable.
  - **H_004** cost-floor 🟡 PARTIAL — 25× gap learning-curve-plausible (~16 doublings @ 18% LR),
    but the $24/ton (= J₂) endpoint sits below the $50/$100 reference floors (unverified-optimistic).
  - **H_005** honeycomb-geometry 🟢 SUPPORTED — hexagon is the min-wall cell among plane-tiling
    regular polygons {3,4,6}; honest limit held (n=12 lower → not the global min).
  - **H_006** n6-numerology-predictor 🟢 SUPPORTED (skeptic holds) — 3/6 lattice→target identities
    physically implausible + physics-blind relabel matches 5/5 → the n=6 lattice is a decorative
    label, not a predictor.
- Harness (`tool/carbon_capture.py`): added `co2_mass_fraction` (gravimetric bound, H_003) and
  `perimeter_area_ratio` (honeycomb P/√A, H_005); `M_CO2` constant.
- `HYPOTHESES/REGISTRY.jsonl`: 6 registry lines (tiers 🟢×5, 🟡×1). Cards `H_001..H_006` + run
  scripts/`result.json` under `state/H_00*_2026-06-27/`.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json` lockstep: `convergence.records[numerology-not-physical]` (verify lattice
  numbers against physics before goal-setting); `L0.sorbent` 48 mmol/g flagged unreachable;
  `thesis.cost-floor` $24/ton flagged optimistic; `verification` node lists the 6 verdicts.

## 2026-06-27 — import echoes provenance excerpt

- Added `state/echoes-carbon-capture-excerpt.md`: the echoes-side surface entry for carbon
  capture (HEXA-Earth "Environment Toolkit" toolkit + closure rows, multilingual mirrors,
  + concrete-mineralization cross-link), imported from `dancinlab/echoes` README. Seed of
  record alongside the deep `state/n6-carbon-capture-spec.md`; CLAUDE.md gotcha updated.

## 2026-06-27 — hypothesis-verification system

- Scaffolded `HYPOTHESES/` (anima-parity): `CLAUDE.md`, empty `REGISTRY.jsonl`,
  `cards/_TEMPLATE.md` (domains sorbent…system). Ready for the first pre-registered card.
- Added repo-root shared harness `tool/carbon_capture.py` (stdlib-only): Sherwood
  separation floor `min_separation_work`, `energy_headroom`, capacity/cost/annual ratios,
  + `Falsifier`/`evaluate` ledger. Smoke-test reproduces the spec: W_min(420 ppm) ≈
  19.27 kJ/mol ≈ J₂−τ, and the 24×/25×/250× n=6 ratios. `tool/CLAUDE.md` folder guide.
- `ARCHITECTURE.json`: added the `verification` node (HYPOTHESES + tool) in lockstep.

## 2026-06-27 — repo scaffold

- Initialized `dancinlab/carbon-capture` mirroring the `dancinlab/lumen` / `dancinlab/rtsc`
  skeleton: `src/`, `state/`, `ARCHITECTURE.json` + `architecture.html` viewer + `serve.py`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `.harness/`.
- Imported the HEXA-CCUS origin spec from `dancinlab/hexa-grid` (`CARBON-CAPTURE.md`,
  ~17k lines) into `state/n6-carbon-capture-spec.md` as the seed of record.
- Authored `ARCHITECTURE.json` SSOT: 7-level HEXA-CCUS stack (L0 sorbent → L6 universal),
  n=6 lattice (φ=2 · τ=4 · σ=12 · J₂=24), distilled from the imported spec.
